# Twit DID

The Twit DID method is an implementation of the [DID Core Specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) that relies upon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as a means of partial trust and resolution.

Twitter DIDs are distinguishable from other DID methods as they tie into an existing social media account, and often contain human-readable identifiers.

## Spec

View the [spec here](spec/index.md).

## CLI

The DID Twitter Organization has created a CLI to facilitate simple generation, update, and deactivation of `did:twit` documents. The CLI may further be expanded to hook into the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview) for DID management and resolution.
