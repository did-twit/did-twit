{"name":"did-twitter","tagline":"Twitter DID Method","body":"# Twitter DID\r\n\r\nThe Twitter DID method is an implementation of the [DID Core Specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) that relies upon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as a means of partial trust and resolution.\r\n\r\nTwitter DIDs are distinguishable from other DID methods as they tie into an existing social media account, and often contain human-readable identifiers.\r\n\r\n## Spec\r\nView the [spec here](spec/index.md).\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n\r\nThe DID Twitter Organization has created a CLI to facilitate simple generation, update, and deactivation of `did:twitter` documents. The CLI may further be expanded to hook into the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview) for DID management and resolution.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome any and all contributors. Please feel free to open up a pull request, create issues, or reach out to the developers directly to get involved.","note":"Don't delete this file!
